# Record your song
During the recording process, the audio file you uploaded will begin playing.
As it plays you can use the device you chose and MidiHero record your inputs!

# Select the song you want to play
Once you are done recording songs, they will appear in a list on the main screen.
The number next to the song is the difficulty rating.

If your song has more notes per minute, the higher the difficulty rating!

# Play!
Finally, play the song you recorded!

The notes will fall from the top of the screen in the same way you recorded them earlier.
The game will keep track of your score and streak, as well as indicate how accurate your timing is (MISS, OKAY, GOOD, GREAT, PERFECT)
